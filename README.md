For the mutual progress of humanity and science, we must be able to use AI, not as mere tools but as our able teammates. In the Humans, Hybrid AI, and Machines (HAIM, rhymes with “time”) laboratory, led by Dr. Shreya Banerjee, our overarching research goal is to make progress in this direction, using hybrid artificial intelligence methods. Hybrid artificial intelligence techniques combines connectionist AI with the power of computational logic and reasoning to render safe and trustworthy methods for real-world problem-solving. This, more often than not, leads to exploration of problems at the intersection of Computer Science and other scientific domains that call for interdisciplinary approaches.
